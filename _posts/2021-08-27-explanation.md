Hey there! Thanks for the amazing support and the 2 views which are my own alt accounts. Means a lot to me. For someone who accidently stumbles here, I'd like to let you know I write my stories using prompts. Currently I'm using prompts from some grade 10th questions site. I post those prompts on twitter handle hairlesscookie. Will be adding that to my abouts soon. Thanks for the support and time. I assure you I won't let you down with my content (neither will I give you up).
